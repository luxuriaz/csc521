Parser: 20/30

  The parser's code seems functional but I was unable to run it because of the
  lack of documentation. This led to me being unable to test it.

Interpreter: 14/20

  There was no documentation on how to run the interpreter within the readme.
  Because of this I didn't know how to do the file input because of the parse
  having some issues with parsing.

  There does show some signs of work.

Style: 17/20

  While there was a readme, it didn't have any information such as how to run
  the files as well as what version of python was being used.
